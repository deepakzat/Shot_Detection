# Shot_Detection

Cricket is a globally loved sport, and with advancements in technology, analyzing the nuances of gameplay has become an exciting area of research. One such innovation is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for shot detection in cricket.

This system leverages the power of CNNs to identify and classify cricket shots from pictures. The process involves preprocessing video frames to extract meaningful features and training a CNN model to recognize cricket strokes such as drives, leg glance-flicks, pullshots, and sweeps. The model learns to distinguish these shots based on unique patterns like the angle of the bat, body posture
